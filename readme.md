# OpenCV-Python

### in this repository you will find how to:

- Playing a video record from file
- foreground/background segmentation using image difference,time derivation,moving average,Running Average,median filter
- foreground/background segmentation MOG,MO2,GMG:
- optical flow calculation
- follow the hand using SIFT points of interest

### Requirements:
 - python3
 - opencv library installed or try:
      - pip3 install opencv-python
      - pip3 install opencv-contrib-python
